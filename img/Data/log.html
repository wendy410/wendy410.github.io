  Easter Egg! :) <br>
  2020-07-05 <br>
  -------------- <br>
  Recent highlights <br>
  $100 for a linux machine((( <br>
  try to build NAS with it <br>
  openmediavault?? it f〇cked me up!! <br>
  too many errors!! :( <br>
  even worse it messed os up <br>
  reinstalled os for 4 times lol <br>
  my 128gb usb stick broken... <br>
  cuz the f〇cking power is too low!! <br>
  2 usb hard disks unstable... <br>
  1.2A total? r u kiddin' me!? <br>
  <br>
  ok gave up gui <br>
  try to use samba <br>
  it worked! <br>
  but due to the power limit... <br>
  1 usb hdd only OMG <br>
  <br>
  alright then try to use it without hdmi <br>
  (cuz vnc won't work with hdmi unconnected) <br>
  another linux environment required OMG <br>
  created a live usb <br>
  after modifying config.txt... <br>
  black screen occured!!?? <br>
  after a while I finally discovered <br>
  the file got broken without any reasons??? <br>
  ok ok... <br>
  let's recreate it! <br>
  (linux permission control so annoying!) <br>
  write something into it... <br>
  it works :) <br>
  <br>
  A few days later... <br>
  try to install zorin os on usb!! <br>
  well it was difficult <br>
  learned a lot about like... <br>
  uefi boot/efi partition/grub/etc. <br>
  at the first step the boot file was written to <br>
  the efi partition of my note pc's internal ssd! <br>
  why?? <br>
  so as a result... <br>
  not bootable on my another pc! <br>
  searched a lot... on the Internet <br>
  repair mbr? won't work <br>
  seems legacy boot on linux <br>
  needs a special partition <br>
  ok let's create it! <br>
  (guided by boot repair) <br>
  yeah it worked! :) <br>
  but I still can't delete the efi boot files <br>
  from my note pc's efi partition <br>
  it won't be booted after deleting them! <br>
  well... <br>
  let them there though <br>
  <br>
  conclusion: <br>
  uefi boot does not require gpt <br>
  (some articles on the Internet seem to have misled me!) <br>
  it requires an efi partition! <br>
  even the partition is on an mbr disk... <br>
  <br>
  A few days later... <br>
  make a webpage and put it on github.io!! <br>
  yeah finished! <br>
  you've already seen it! :) <br>
  <br>

  yeah it looks better :) <br>
  <br>
  To Be Continued... <br>
